  This example is based on the GD32L233R-EVAL-V1.1/GD32L235R-EVAL-V1.0 board, it provides 
a basic communication between USART0 (Synchronous mode) and SPI0. First, USART1 transmits 
a series of data to SPI0, then SPI0 transmits a series of data to USART1. Compare the 
transmitted data and the received data. If the data transmitted from USART0 and received by 
SPI0 are the same, LED1 will be on, otherwise off. If the data transmitted from SPI0 and 
received by USART0 are the same, LED2 will be on, otherwise off.
 
  Connect SPI0 SCK  pin(PA1) TO USART0_CK  pin(PA4)
  Connect SPI0 MISO pin(PA6) TO USART0_RX  pin(PA3)
  Connect SPI0 MOSI pin(PA7) TO USART0_TX  pin(PA2)
