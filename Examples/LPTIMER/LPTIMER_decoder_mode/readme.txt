  This example is based on the GD32L233R - EVAL - V1.0 / GD32L235R - EVAL - V1.0 board, it 
provides a description of LPTIMER decoder mode 0 example.

  LPTIMERN is used in decoder mode 0, it will count with two quadrature signals which input
of LPTIMERN_IN0 (PA6) and LPTIMERN_IN1 (PC2) pins.

  LPTIMERN frequency is set to internal clock IRC32K, the prescaler is 1, so the LPTIMERN
counter clock is 32KHz.

  LPTIMERN configuration:
  generate 1 PWM signal with the duty cycle:
  LPTIMERCLK = IRC32K / 1 = 32KHz.
  LPTIMERN_O duty cycle = (50 / 100) * 100  = 50 %.

  Connect the PA6 and PC2 with quadrature external signals.
  Connect the LPTIMERN_O pin (PA4) to an oscilloscope to monitor the PWM waveform.
