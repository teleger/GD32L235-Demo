  This demo is based on the GD32L235R-EVAL-V1.0, it shows how to configure the
comparator blank function.

  CMP0 is configured as following:
  - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.2V.
  - Non inverting input is connected to PA1.
  - Output is internally connected to port output(PA6).
  - TIMER1_CH1 is selected as blanking source.
  - PA1 is connected to TIMER1_CH3(PA3).
  TIMER1 is configured as following:
  - TIMER clock frequency is set to systemcoreclock.
  - Prescaler is set to 64 make the counter clock is 1MHz.
  - Configure TIMER1_CH1 as the blank source.
  - Counter autoreload value is 9999 and CH1/CH3 output compare value is 499/4999.
  - TIMER1_CH1/TIMER1_CH3 outputs PWM with 5/50% dutycycle.

  Connect PA3 and PA1 as CMP non inverting input. use oscilloscope to observe CMP
input pin(PA1) and output pin(PA6) at the same time, the output signal is low level at the
beginning of the dutycycle.
